# Sales-Dashboard-
customer analysis dashboard looks at revenue and sales using customer-based data. Although it will work best for companies that sell their products to a limited number of clients, the ability to group customers means that it can be used by any company regardless of the customer base size. For example, group customers by region and you can see a heatmap that shows which customer regions perform best.
